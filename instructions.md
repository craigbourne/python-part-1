1. Create a contact book in Python to demonstrate:
  - Inserting
  - Deleting
  - Sorting
  - Searching 

2. Produce appropriate algorithm(s) using either flowchart or pseudocode.

3. Checkpoints and test along with expected outcomes. For example:
  - Check whether the first name of the user is added
  - Check last name of the user is deleted or not?
  - Check whether sorting and searching are functioning

4. Produce evidence with an outline of the expected test results. For example, expected test results are supposed to be the first name of the user like “ABC”. Has it been produced? Just a couple would be fine.

5. Conclusion: A summary (brief) of what you have done.
